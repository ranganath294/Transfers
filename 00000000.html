Earlier the query filter used to be for a particular sp and then I used to use a for loop to get data for a list of sps. Now as we are using for a list of sps it is accessing many rows at a time. So it is becoming heavy. I want to optimise it as much as possible and use any alternate methods of creating the same data. Like I am using pandas already for this. So like may be doing transformations on data in Python code so that the load on db reduces. Etc
