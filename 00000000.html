The main changes I've made include:

Created separate containers for phase filters and status filters with mb-3 class for spacing
Removed the mt-3 class from the status button group since we're controlling spacing via containers
Added responsive styles to handle button wrapping and sizing
Updated the button container structure to stack filters vertically
Improved the layout with flexbox for better responsive behavior

The filters will now appear:

Phase filters on top row
Status filters on second row
Pagination controls below both filter riws
