in this, in Issues column each row will be comma seperated and we are using strip and then split. What i want is sometimes there are duplicates in the isssues that is in comma seperated values sometimes there are duplicates. so affter exploding because in same cell there are duplicates, after exploding they are becoming two rows and count is increasing. so to remove these duplicates, it is better to remove before epxloding or after exploding. If we want to remove after exploding then it means we will get those duplicate rows completely same for all columns. we can do unique on all columns. if we want to remove duplicates before exploding then on each row of CR column we need to remove use unique. give bothe ways and whcih is better, like efficient etc
