lets work on this template. 

It gets data from the given python code. 

In this what i need is in renderCumulativeTable, there needs to be two more coloumns. One coloumn is Unique CRs Raised, and it needs to be filled with the unique_cr_list in this format unique_cr_count(it shows the unique_crs from the list) like this 

11( CR-3222946 ; CR-3194087 ;CR-3221205 ; CR-3218062 ; CR-3218019 ;CR-3198555 ; CR-3233089 ; CR-3233081 ;CR-3207944 ; CR-3209461 ; CR-3221799 )

and similarly another coloumn will be Unique Jiras which will be filled with the unique_jira_list and its count in sam eway. 



And also, these counts are sometimes so many more. So what we will do is if the count us more than 15 or any pre configurable number, if the count is more than that, then instead of showing in the table directly we can show some of them  and write more..... and on clikcing on more a modal pops up which shows only those lists  and it needs to be scrollable and on the modal there willl be a cross symbol as well for closing the modal. Compute these lists to be shows in the same way as we are doing for other metrics.
