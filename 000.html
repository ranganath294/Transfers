after loading, and the selected another team on team filter then data is loaded corresponding and then there is first coloumn right which has + icons and clicking on it render another inner table. Now what is happening is suppose after loading we chose team1 in team filters and data is rendered. Now all the + icons and - icons are working perfectly. Now them we selected another team2 in team filters. Then the data is rendered perfectly and all but the + icons are kor working there us no rendering of new table. But now if we again select team1 then the + - icons for team1 data is working. What I meant to say those icons and rendering inner table is working good only for the team that is selected first.
