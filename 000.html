This is the sample table_data, that is one sp may have multiple teams. One team may have multiple phases. One phase may have multiple coverage types. Now when team filters buttons clicked we are rendering the cumulative values such a sp and a team is fixed. And we are not considering coverage types and calculating cumulative values of coverage types for each phase and rendering the data. Now what I want is we will keep a + kind of symbol like icon along with phase in the first coloumn while rendering it and when we clicked on any phases + icon then what happens is sp, team, phase is fixed. So we show the values based on coverage types available. Team got fixed in teamfilter button and phase got fixed from the + icon we clicked near the phase in first coloumn. So we render another table with the same metrics based on coverage types. And the new table rendered should be just immediately the row of which phase we selected. And make this new table like a branch that is for the main table this new one should go a bit towards right and it should have the following coloumns, coverage types, total tcs, coverage, coverage %, pass, pass %, Fail, fail%, Block, block%, unique crs for that coverage type, unique jiras and these crs and jiras should be displayed same like we are doing for this cumulative metrics table. And also make the ui good and responsive and suitable colors
